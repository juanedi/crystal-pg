# crystal-pg
A Postgres driver for Crystal

## usage

### shards

Add this to your `shard.yml` and run `crystal deps`

``` yml
dependencies:
  pg:
    github: will/crystal-pg
```

### connecting

``` crystal
require "pg"
DB = PG.connect("postgres://...")
```

### typed querying

The preferred way to send queries is to send a tuple of the types you expect
back along with the query. `#rows` will then be an array of tuples with each
element properly casted. You can also use parameterized queries for
injection-safe server-side interpolation.

``` crystal
result = DB.exec({Int32, String}, "select id, email from users")
result.fields  #=> [PG::Result::Field, PG::Result::Field]
result.rows    #=> [{1, "will@example.com"}], …]
result.to_hash #=> [{"field1" => value, …}, …]

result = DB.exec({String}, "select $1::text || ' ' || $2::text", ["hello", "world"])
result.rows #=> [{"hello world"}]
```

Out of the box, crystal-pg supports 1-32 types. If you need more, you can
reopen `PG::Result` and use the `generate_gather_rows` macro. If your field can
return nil, you should use `Int32|Nil` for example, which is a union of the
type and `Nil`.

### untyped querying

If you do not know the types beforehand you can omit them. However you will get
back an array of arrays of PGValue. Since it is a union type of amost every
type, you will probably have to manually cast later on in your program.

``` crystal
result = DB.exec("select * from table")
result.fields  #=> [PG::Result::Field, …]
result.rows    #=> [[value, …], …]
result.to_hash #=> [{"field1" => value, …}, …]

result = DB.exec("select $1::text || ' ' || $2::text", ["hello", "world"])
result.rows #=> [["hello world"]]
```

## Requirements

Crystal-pg is [tested on](https://travis-ci.org/will/crystal-pg) Postgres
versions 9.1 through 9.4 and developed on 9.5 (travis does not currently have
9.5 support). Since it uses protocal version 3, older versions probably also
work but are not guaranteed.

Linking requires that the `pg_config` binary is in your `$PATH` and returns
correct results for `pg_config --includedir` and `pg_config --libdir`.

## Supported Datatypes

- text
- boolean
- int8, int2, int4
- float4, float8
- timestamptz, date, timestamp (but no one should use ts when tstz exists!)
- json and jsonb
- uuid
- bytea
- numeric/decimal (1)
- varchar
- regtype
- geo types: point, box, path, lseg, polygon, circle, line

1: A note on numeric: In postgres this type has arbitrary percision. In this
    driver, it is represented as a `PG::Numeric` which retians all precision, but
    if you need to do any math on it, you will probably need to cast it to a
    float first. If you need true abitrary percision, you can optionally
    require `pg_ext/big_rational` which adds `#to_big_r`, but requires that you
    have LibGMP installed.
